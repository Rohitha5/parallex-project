        <h2>DOSA</h2>
        <p>
          A dosa is a thin, savoury crepe in South Indian cuisine made from a fermented batter of ground white gram and rice. Dosas are served hot, often with chutney and sambar (a lentil-based vegetable stew). Dosas are popular in South Asia as well as around the world.
          <h4>history</h4>The dosa originated in South India, but its precise geographical origins are unknown. According to food historian K. T. Achaya, references in the Sangam literature suggest that dosa was already in use in the ancient Tamil country around the 1st century CE. However, according to historian P. Thankappan Nair, dosa originated in the town of Udupi in present-day Karnataka. Achaya states that the earliest written mention of dosa appears in the 8th-century literature of present-day Tamil Nadu, while the earliest mention of dosa in Kannada literature appears a century later.
          <h4>Nutrition</h4>Dosa is high in carbohydrates and contains no added sugars. As its key ingredients are rice and black gram, it is a good source of protein.A typical homemade plain dosa without oil contains about 112 calories, of which 84% is carbohydrate and 16% is protein. The fermentation process increases the vitamin B and vitamin C content.

        <h2>Sambar idly</h2>
        <p>
          Idli or idly is a type of savoury rice cake, originating from South India, popular as a breakfast food in Southern India and in Sri Lanka. The cakes are made by steaming a batter consisting of fermented black lentils  and rice. The fermentation process breaks down the starches so that they are more readily metabolised by the body.

Idli has several variations, including rava idli, which is made from semolina. Regional variants include sanna of Konkan.
         <h4>history</h4>A precursor of the modern idli is mentioned in several ancient Indian works. Vaddaradhane, a 920 CE Kannada language work by Shivakotiacharya, mentions "iddalige", prepared only from a black gram batter. Chavundaraya II, the author of the earliest available Kannada encyclopedia, Lokopakara (c.1025 CE), describes the preparation of this food by soaking black gram in buttermilk, ground to a fine paste, and mixed with the clear water of curd and spices.[1] The Western Chalukya king and scholar Someshwara III, reigning in the area now called Karnataka, included an idli recipe in his encyclopedia, Manasollasa (1130 CE). This Sanskrit-language work describes the food as iḍḍarikā. In Karnataka, the Idli in 1235 CE is described as being "light, like coins of high value", which is not suggestive of a rice base.[2] The food prepared using this recipe is now called uddina idli in Karnataka.
         <h4>Nutritions</h4>dli have 6.36 g protein per 100g.
         When you multiplay this value with weight of medium size Idli (39 g) you can see that you will get about 2.5 g of protein.
         
         Carbs in Idli
         Idli have 24.98 g carbohydrates per 100g.
         In the same way as for protein we can calculate that medium size Idli (39 g) has about 9.7 g of carbs.
         
         Fat in Idli
         Idli have 0.35 g fat per 100g.
         So it is easy to count that medium size Idli (39 g) has about 0.1 g of fat.

        <h2>Uttapam</h2>
        <p>
          An uttapam (or uthapam, uttappam, etc.) is a type of dosa from South India. Unlike a typical dosa, which is crisp and crepe-like, an uttapam is thicker, with toppings. The name is derived from the Tamil words appam and utthia or uttria, meaning "poured appam", because appam is cooked in a round-bottom pan, whereas utthia-appam is cooked on a flat skillet. Tamil ancient literature mentions it by name. The classic breakfast of Tamil residents consists of idli, dosas or uttappams mostly accompanied by sambar and chutney.

          it is similar to a dosa, but it has more vegetable and preparation time It is famous in South India, mainly Kerala and Tamil Nadu.
          <h4>Nutritions</h4>65 calories for 1 uttapam of Onion Uttapam, South Indian Onion Uttapam, Cholesterol 0 mg, Carbohydrates 13.7 g, Protein 22.3 g, Fat 0.1 g.
